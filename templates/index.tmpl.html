Intro: 4/4 
||:  Bm  |  F#  |  A  |  E  |  G  |  D  |  Em  |  F#  :|| x2

Bm                            F#
1. On a dark de-sert high-way___ Cool wind in my hair
A                          E
Warm smell of col-i-tas___ Ris-ing up through the air
G                             D
Up a-head in the dis-tance___ I saw a shim-mer-ing light
Em                                           F#
My head grew hea-vy and my sight grew dim___ I had to stop for the night


Bm                                 F#
2. There she stood in the door-way___ I heard the mis-sion bell
A                                                  E
And I was thin-king to my-self___ This could be Hea-ven or this could be  Hell
G                            D
Then she lit up a can-dle___ And she showed me the way
Em                                        F#
There were voi-ces down the cor-ri-dor___ I thought I heard them say

G                             D
Chorus: Welcome to the Ho-tel Cal-i-for-nia
F#                                               Bm
Such a love-ly place (Such  a  love-ly place)___ Such a love-ly face
G                                   D
Plen-ty of room at the Ho-tel Cal-i-for-nia
Em                                         F#
Any time of year (Any time of year)___ You can find it here

Bm                                  F#
3. Her mind is ‘Tif-fa-ny twist-ed’___ She got the Mer-ce-des bends___ (ooh)
A                                        E
She got a lot of pret-ty pret-ty boys___ She calls friends
G                                       D
How they dance in the court-yard___ Sweet sum-mer sweat
Em                          F#
Some dance to re-mem-ber___ Some dance to for-get

Bm                              F#
4. So I called up the Cap-tain___ “Please bring me my wine"
A                                            E
He said, "We have-n't had that spi-rit here___ Since  nine-teen six-ty nine"
G                                            D
And still those voi-ces are cal-ling from far a-way
Em                                         F#
Wake you up in the mid-dle of the night___ Just to hear them say-ay

G                             D
Chorus: Welcome to the Ho-tel Cal-i-for-nia
F#                                             Bm
Such a love-ly place (Such a love-ly place)___ Such a love-ly face
G                                 D
They’re liv-in' it up at the Ho-tel Cal-i-for-nia
Em                                                  F#
What a nice sur-prise (what a nice sur-prise)___ Bring your al-i-bis

Bm                         F#
5. Mir-rors on the ceil-ing___ The pink cham-pagne on ice
A                                    E
And she said  "We are all just pris-on-ers  here___ Of our own device"
G                                 D
And in the mas-ter's cham-bers___ They ga-thered for their feast
Em                                                    F#
They stab it with their steel-y knives___ But they just can't kill the beast

Bm                                F#
6. Last thing I re-mem-ber___ I was  run-ning for the door
A                                             E
I had to find the pas-sage back___ To the place I was be-fore
G                                      D
"Relax" said the night man___ "We are  pro-grammed to re-ceive
Em                                      F#    
You can check-out a-ny time you like___ But you can ne-ver leave!"

INTRO: 
G Bb C, G Bb C# C, G Bb C Bb G (6x)

G
We all came out to Montreal
F       G
On our way to Rio's shoreline
To make records with the mobile
F          G
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
F      G          
We're at the best place around
When some stupid with a flagon
F        G
Burned the place to the ground


CHORUS:
C            Ab
Smoke on the water
G
A fire in the sky!
C            Ab
Smoke on the water-

(Do INTRO 2x)

G
It burned down the gamblin' house
F      G
It died with an awful sound
A funky clod was running in and out
F        G
Pulling kids on the ground
When it all was over
F       G
We had to find another place
But swiss time was running out
F        G
It seemed that we would lose the race

(Repeat CHORUS)

AD LIB: G---  C7-F

(Repeat INTRO Twice)

G
We ended up at the Ground Hotel
F        G
It was empty, cold and dead
But with the Rolling truck Stones
playing just outside
F                G
Making our music bad
With the fumin' lights a few old bids
F                     G
We made the place to swell
No matter what we get out of this
F      G
I know, I know we'll never forget

(Repeat CHORUS)

C                    C6
When I feel like the world's gone mad
Cmaj7
And I need you so bad
C                    F
But I don't know where you are
G          C
I cry these tears

C                  C6
On our own, we've been so far
Cmaj7
We've sworn at the moon
C                 F
And we've counted a million stars
G            C
My love's still true

C                    C6
Friends have come and gone
Cmaj7
Some have left me alone
C                      F
But I've stared at these walls before
G        C
And they've made me blue

C                C6
All along in my heart I've known
Cmaj7            C
There's one thing in my life 
F
That still rings true
G        C
I can count on you


[Chorus]

C
Count on you to be there
F
No questions in the air
C
No asking why or where
G
No looking back

C
Count on you every time
F
To ease my worried mind
C               C
You'll forever be important to me
G
My miracle find


[Verse]

C             C6
If I had to choose one place
Cmaj7                C
To spend the rest of my days

Anywhere would do

Oh, woah, oh

[Verse 1]
D               Dmaj7
And now, the end is near,
D7            B7
And so I face the final curtain,
Em7                Em7/D
My friend. I'll say it clear,
Em7/C#   A7       D
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
D                   D7
I've lived a life that's full.
G             Gm
I traveled each and every highway,
D                    A       Asus4   G    D
And more, much more than this, I did it m      y way.


[Verse 2]
D               Dmaj7
Regrets, I've had a few,
D7                B7
But then again, too few to mention.
Em7               Em7/D
I did what I had to do,
Em7/C#   A7    D
And saw it thru without exemption.
D                    D7
I planned each charted course,
G              Gm
Each careful step along the byway,
D                    A     Asus4    G        D
And more, much more than this, I did it m      y way.


[Verse 3]
D                   D7
Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
G                     Gsus4 G
When I bit off more than I could chew,
Em               A7
But thru it all, when there was doubt,
F#m               Bm7
I ate it up, and spit it out.
Em               A
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
Asus4    G       D
And did it m      y way.


[Verse 4]
D               Dmaj7
I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
D7                B7
I've had my fill; my share of losing.
Em7               Em7/D
And now, as tears subside,
Em7/C#   A7    D
I find it all so  amusing.
D                    D7
To think I did all that;
G              Gm
And may I say - not in a shy way,
D   A       Asus4        G    D
"No, oh no not me, I did it m   y way".


[Verse 5]
D               D7
For what is a man, what has he got?
G
If not himself, then he has naught.
Em7               A7
To say the things he truly feels;  
F#m                Bm7
And not the words of one who kneels.
Em7               A         Asus4    G      D
The record shows I took the blows - And did it m   y way!</pre>

Intro: [G]  [C]       [G]  [D]     [G] [D7]
[G] The old home town looks the same
As I [C] step down from the [G] train,
And there to meet me is my mama and [D] papa. [D7]
Down the [G] road I look and [G7] there runs Mary,
[C] Hair of gold and lips like cherries,
It's [G] good to touch the [D] green, green [D7] grass of [G] home [D7]

Yes, they'll [G] all come to [G7] meet me,
Arms [C] reaching, smiling sweetly,
it's [G] good to touch the [D] green, green [D7] grass of [G] home. [D7]
The [G] old house is still [G7] standing, though the [C] paint is cracked and [G] dry,
And there's that old oak tree that I used to [D] play on. [D7]
Down the [G] lane I walk and with [G7] my sweet Mary,
[C] Hair of gold and lips like cherries,
It's [G] good to touch the [D] green, green [D7] grass of [G] home.

[G] Then I awake and look around me [C] at the four gray walls that su[G]rround me,
And I realize, yes, I  was only [D] dreaming.  [D7]
For there's a [G] guard and there's a [G7] sad old padre,
[C] Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak,
[G] Again I'll touch the [D] green, green [D7] grass of [G] home. [C] [G]

Yes, they'll [G] all come to [G7] see me in the [C] shade of that old oak tree,
As they [G] lay me ‘neath the [D] green, green [D7] grass of [G] home. [C] [G]

In my loneliness,
            G6
When you're gone and I'm all by myself,

And I need your caress
Am7    Cm6
I just think of you,

Though you're far away,

I have only to close my eyes,

And you are back to stay

I just close my eyes,

And the sadness that missing you brings

And that for me is all I need to know

I will wait for you,

Til the sun falls from out of the sky,
    Bm7                E7/-9
For what else can I do
Am7    Cm6
I will wait for you

Meditating, how sweet life will be,

When you come back to me

Tall and tanned and young and lovely

And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ahhh!

When she walks, shes like a samba

That swings so cool and sways so gentle

We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.
Dm      Am7  Gm7 Am7        Dm   Am7  Gm7 Am7
City lights             and business nights.
     Dm      Am7  Gm7 Am7            Dm   Am7  Gm7 Am7
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights.
 
Gm7             Am7                    Dm     Dm/Db  Am7/C   Am7/B
No place for    beginners or sensitive hearts
Gm7             Am7            Dm     Dm/Db  Am7/C   Am7/B
When sentiment is left to chance.
Gm7             Am7                    Dm
No place to be ending but somewhere to start.
Fill A
 
No need to ask.

Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.
 
 
[Verse]
Face to face, each classic case.
 
We shadow box and double cross,
 
Yet need the chase.
""Some where here is the guitar, sax solo" "Dorfun make it your own
solo"
 
Gm7                     Am7    Dm
A license to love, insurance to hold.
Gm7                             Am7       Dm
Melts all your memories and change into gold.
Gm7                     Am7              Dm
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold.
Fill A

         G             Em
When the night has come and the land is dark
        C           D                G
And the moon is the only light we'll see
     G                        Em
No I won't be afraid, no I, I won't be afraid
        C           D               G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      G
And darling, darling, stand by me
            Em
Oh nah, nah, stand by me
C            D         G
 Stand by me, stand by me
 
 
[Verse]
 
        G                   Em
If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
        C                D              G
and the mountains should crumble to the sea
        G                          Em
I won't cry. I won't cry,  no I, I won't shed a tear
        C           D               G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      G
And darling, darling, stand by me
            Em

Are we really   happy   with
     Em7/D           A7
This lonely game we play
Em              C9          B7
Looking for the right words to say
Em                EmMaj7/D#
Searching but not finding

E                       Emaj7
When I was young I’d listen to the radio
C#m                     C#m7
Waitin’ for my favorite songs
Amaj7                   B      C#m7
When they played I’d sing along
A               B      B7
It made me smile
 
E                       Emaj7
Those were such happy times, and not so long ago
C#m                     C#m7
How I wondered where they’d gone
Cm
But they’re back again
C#m7
Just like a long lost friend
Amaj7           B7
All the songs I loved so well
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E                       C#m7
Every sha-la-la-la, every wo-wo-wo
E
Still shines
E                       C#m7
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they’re starting to sing’s
A                       B7
So fine
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
 
Cm                              Gm7
When they get to the part, where he’s breakin’ her heart
A                       Am5
It can really make me cry
E                       A
Just like before
E
It’s yesterday once more
 
 
[Verse]
 
E                       Emaj7
Lookin’ back on how it was, in years gone by
C#m                     C#m7
And the good times that I had
Amaj7                   B      C#m7
Makes today seem rather sad
A               B      B7
So much has changed
 
E                       Emaj7
It was songs of love that I would sing to then
C#m                     C#m7
And I’d memorize each word
C#m
Those old melodies
C#m7
Still sound so good to me
Amaj7           B7
As they melt the years away
